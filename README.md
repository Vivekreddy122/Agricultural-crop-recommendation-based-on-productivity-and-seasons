# Agricultural-crop-recommendation-based-on-productivity-and-seasons

Overview:
The Agricultural Crop Recommendation System leverages machine learning algorithms to recommend the best crop for a given area based on various environmental factors. These factors include soil pH, weather conditions, temperature, humidity, and more. The goal of the system is to assist farmers in maximizing their yield by recommending the most suitable crops for the given conditions, optimizing productivity, and ensuring sustainable farming practices.

Problem Statement: 
Farmers often face difficulties in selecting the best crops to grow due to varying soil conditions, weather, and other environmental factors. Traditional methods of crop selection can lead to suboptimal yields, crop failure, and inefficient use of resources. This project aims to use machine learning models to predict the ideal crops for a given region based on key environmental variables, enhancing productivity and sustainability.

Key Features: 
Predictive Modeling: Use of Decision Trees, Random Forests, and other machine learning models to predict optimal crops.
Environmental Factors: Incorporates five key environmental factors for crop selection:
Soil pH – Determines the suitability of soil for specific crops.
Temperature – Helps in selecting crops that thrive under specific temperature ranges.
Humidity – Affects the growth of crops; some plants prefer high humidity, while others require drier conditions.
Weather Conditions – Seasonal and regional weather patterns influence crop growth.
Soil Type – Certain crops require specific soil types for optimal growth.

Machine Learning Algorithms Used
Decision Tree Classifier: A tree-like model used to make decisions based on input features. It helps to map conditions to the best crop recommendations.
Random Forest Classifier: An ensemble method that improves prediction accuracy by combining multiple decision trees.
Support Vector Machine (SVM): Classifies data into different crop categories, optimizing for accuracy.

Dataset: 
The dataset used for training and testing consists of historical data on crop yields based on various environmental conditions. This dataset includes:
Soil pH values
Temperature data for different seasons
Humidity levels
Soil types
Weather conditions (rainfall, wind speed, etc.)
Crop yields for different seasons
The data is preprocessed and divided into training and testing datasets to train the models and validate their accuracy.

How It Works: 
Data Collection: Gather data on environmental conditions and crop yields.
Feature Engineering: Prepare and preprocess the data, ensuring it’s ready for machine learning models.
Model Training: Use decision tree-based models and other classifiers to train the system on historical data.
Prediction: Once the model is trained, it predicts the best crop to plant based on input factors such as soil pH, temperature, humidity, and others.
Optimization: Fine-tune model parameters to increase accuracy and efficiency in predicting high-yield crops.
